# SuperKeeks's NES Emulator #

I've always found emulators fascinating. The fact you can play one platform within a completely different hardware architecture was magic to me. For this reason, I decided to write my own emulator, so I could really get a good grasp of how they work in the inside.

As for the platform, I picked the NES. It felt the right balance between complexity for the job (easy and well documented hardware and features) and nostalgia (the NES was my first ever console)

During this trip I learned things like:

* How old game systems used to work and how games for them were made.
* Refreshed my assembly knowledge (which I haven't used since uni) and learnt 6502 assembly.
* Also refreshed my hardware knowledge (again not used since uni)
* Implemented low level audio code for the first time in my life.
* Learned the basics of the SDL2 game engine.
* Writing unit tests from day 1 (and writing unit tests in general)

Overall it was an amazing experience I recommend to everyone that has a good programming level (not because any code is particularly complex, but it has to be done VERY CAREFULLY and clean) and basic hardware knowledge.

TODO: Slides

**Disclaimer:** Most of the code has been written from scratch without following any  specific tutorial, papers, etc.. Because of this, there's probably (100% sure!) better ways of doing this. Please also keep in mind that despite I've done some optimizations to the code, it wasn't created with performance as a main objective and it is not intended to be used in "real world" applications.
