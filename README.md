# SuperKeeks's NES Emulator #

TODO: Slides

TODO: **Disclaimer:** Most of the code has been written from scratch without following any rasterization specific tutorial, papers, etc.. Because of this, there's probably (100% sure!) better ways of doing this. Please also keep in mind that despite I've done some optimizations to the code, it wasn't created with performance as a main objective and it is not intended to be used in "real world" applications.
