Notes:
<ul><li>The colour mask settings can be combined, but doing so will make the display even darker. If you set all three, the display will lose 75% of it's brightness.
<li>Clipping is useful for masking glitches that occur on the edges of the screen. BG Clipping can be used to mask tile changes when Scrolling horizontally (see Ultima: Exodus to see what I mean); Sprite Clipping can be used so Sprites that move off-screen (left/right) will disappear normally (without it, they will just suddenly blink out of existence and reappear on the other side of the screen).

<li>I'm not sure what the VRAM Write Flag means.

This is a very handy way to deal with Sprites. When you write a value here, 256 bytes are automagically transferred to Sprite-RAM. The address read from is $xx00-$xxFF, where xx is the value written.<br>
You can make the most of this by setting aside $100 bytes of RAM (such as $0700-$07FF) as a Sprite DMA table. You can then modify the data there instead of manually via $2003/$2004. When everything's ready, just write the page number (in this case, $07) to $4014. <i>Einfach!</i> (Nothing to it!)</td></tr>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>You must "strobe" the joystick before attempting to read the data. This is done by resetting, then clearing the strobe. You do this by writing $01 and then $00 to $4016. This resets the joystick hardware and it will begin sending out the button-press status one bit at a time.
<li>Once you've strobed the joystick, you can start reading the data. On each read, the joystick will return the status one button at a time in the lowest bit of $4016. On each successive read, it will return the status of the successive buttons. The button status is returned <i>in this order</i>:
<ol>
<li>A Button
<li>B Button
<li>Select
<li>Start
<li>Up arrow
<li>Down arrow
<li>Left arrow
<li>Right arrow
</ol>

<li>If the game uses a mapper (ie., if there's more than 32K of PRG-ROM), it varies which sections are mapped into this space. For games with 32K PRG-ROM space, then simply all of it is mapped into this space. For games with only 16K of PRG-ROM space, it is mapped to both the $8000-$BFFF and $C000-$FFFF regions.
<li>For all mappers except MMC5, you communicate with it by writing values to mapper registers mapped in the $8000-$FFFF. The actual registers, their locations, and their functions vary from mapper to mapper, of course.
<li>Writing values to the $8000-$FFFF area does not affect the ROM. After all, it's <u>R</u>ead-<u>O</u>nly <u>M</u>emory, right?

The PPU has it's own 16K area, known as VRAM. It is accessed by writing the address (high byte first) to $2006, then accessing the data in question via $2007. So, here is a PPU Memory map:<br><br>

This is where the graphic tiles are stored. You can view these in NESticle by pressing F2.<br><br>
Notes:
<ul><li>Bits 3 and 4 (---XX---) of $2000 control which half of the Pattern Table is used by the Sprites and the Background. For the tile index numbers used for Sprites/BG, they refer to that half of the pattern tables. You <i>can</i> map both the Sprites and the Background to the same half (such as the controls screen of Chris Covell's <i>Solar Wars</i>).
<li>For CHR-RAM based games, this is where you access CHR-RAM.
<li>Each tile is $10 bytes in size; each row of 16 tiles is $100 bytes.
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>$2000-$23BF</td>
<td><b>Name Table #0 (lower-left)</b><br>
The Name Table data controls which tiles go where in the Background. It starts with the upper-left tile, and each successive byte represents the next tile. Each byte represents the tile number in the pattern tables ($0xx0 or $1xx0 depending on PPU Control Register #1 ($2000)).<br><br>
The background (per name table) is 32x30 tiles in size.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td>$23C0-$23FF</td>
<td><b>Attribute Table #0 (lower-left)</b><br>
The Attribute Table data controls which set of colours is used where. Each Attr. Table byte covers a 4x4-tile area, and these areas are laid out left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Each such section is divided into 2x2-tile areas, which is the finest resolution of Attribute Table data. Now, for each byte:
<pre>
44332211
||||||++--- Upper-left 2x2-tile section

For each:
<pre>
00 = First set of four colours (of the BG palette)
01 = Second set of four colours
10 = Third set of four colours
11 = Fourth set of four colours
</pre>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>There are only tiles defined for a 32x30-tile area (in the Name Table), but the Attribute Table data is treated as covering a complete 32x32-tile area. It's a bit confusing, perhaps a diagram may help:<br><br>
<img src=name-attr.gif align=left> Each light/dark area represents a different tile; the differently-coloured areas represent each 2x2-tile part of the Attribute Tables.<br clear=all>

<td><b>Background Colour-Index Array (ie. Palette)</b><br>
Each byte written here is not an absolute colour value, but rather an offset in the colour index used by the PPU to draw the screen. This image will serve as a very valuable reference:<br><br>
<img width=272 height=80 src=nespal.gif align=left>$0F is generally used to represent the colour Black.<br clear=all>
Feel free to download and save that image. Right-click on it and select "Save Image As...".<br><br>
Notes:
<ul>
<li>$3F00 controls the screen background colour. This colour is mirrored every four bytes in the $3F00-$3F1C range. (However, if (via PPU Control Register #2 ($2001)) you tell the PPU not to display the background, it will still always display Black, regardless of the palette BG colour).
<li>You can read the palette data from VRAM without having to conduct a "throw-away" read. I think it has something to do with where the palette data is physically stored in relation to the PPU. Regardless of why, it just IS. I remember that there's a document at <a href=http://nesdev.parodius.com>the NESDEV site</a> explaining why, if you're interested.
